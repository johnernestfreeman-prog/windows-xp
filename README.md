## 🎯 Roadmap / What's Next
 
- [ ] Add a "skip to plain view" option for visitors who prefer a fast, non-3D version
- [ ] Add loading progress indicator for 3D assets on slower connections
- [ ] Mobile/touch controls for the camera zoom interaction
- [ ] Additional desktop apps (e.g. a mini terminal, a notes app)
